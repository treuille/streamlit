# Get started

If you've made it this far, you probably have an idea of what you can do with
Streamlit (if you don't, watch [this
video](https://streamlit.io/secret/demo/)). In this guide, we'll introduce you
to Streamlit's core features and how they are used.

The easiest way to learn how to use Streamlit is to try things out yourself. As
you read through this guide, test each method. As long as your app is
running, every time you add a new element to your script and save, Streamlit's
UI will ask if you'd like to rerun the app and view the changes. This allows
you to work in a fast interactive loop: you write some code, save it, review
the output, write some more, and so on, until youâ€™re happy with the results.
The goal is to use Streamlit to create an interactive app for your data or model
and along the way to use Streamlit to review, debug, perfect, and share your
code.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you're going to need a few things:

- Your favorite IDE or text editor
- [Python 2.7.0 or later / Python 3.6.x or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- One of these package management tools:
  - [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
  - [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)
- [Streamlit](index.md) - Follow these instructions to install Streamlit if you
  haven't already.

## Set up your virtual environment

Regardless of which package management tool you're using, we recommend running
these commands in a virtual environment. This ensures that the dependencies
pulled in for Streamlit don't impact any other your other Python projects
you're working on.

If you're using Conda, you have access to virtual environments by default. If
you need help getting a virtual environment setup, see [Managing
environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

If you're not using Conda, you have a few options:

- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/)

## Import Streamlit

Now that everything's installed, let's create a new Python script and import
Streamlit.

1. Create a new Python file named `first_app.py`, then open it with your IDE
   or text editor.

2. Import Streamlit and add a title. At least one call to Streamlit is required
   to generate an app.

   ```Python
   import streamlit as st
   # To make things easier later, we're also importing numpy and pandas for
   # working with sample data.
   import numpy
   import pandas

   # Don't worry, we'll explain this method in the next section. We need to
   # make at least one call to Streamlit in order to generate an app.
   st.title('My first app')
   ```

3. Run your app. A new tab will open in your default browser, and you should
   see a title. In the next few sections we'll populate the app with
   additional text, tables, and charts.

   ```bash
   $ streamlit run first_app.py
   ```

   Running a Streamlit app is no different than any other Python script.
   Whenever you need to view the app, you can use this command.

4. You can kill the app at any time by typing **Ctrl+c** in the terminal.

## Add text to an app

A good app isn't just charts and data visualizations, it needs clear and
detailed explanations. Streamlit provides a handful of methods that let you add
titles, headers, and text to your apps.

```eval_rst
.. tip::

   This guide focuses on Streamlit's core features. We're adding new
   functionality all the time, so make sure that you check out our `API
   reference <api.html#display-text>`__ for a full list of features.
```

### Start with a title

Most apps start with a title. With Streamlit, you'll use
[`st.title`](api.html#streamlit.title) to add a title to your app.

```eval_rst
.. tip::
   Use `st.title` sparingly. Most apps only need one.
```

This should look familiar. You added this line below the import statement:

```python
st.title('My first app')
```

### Organize with headers

To help you organize the content of your app, there are two methods that
allow you to create headers: [`st.header()`](api.html#streamlit.header) and
[`st.subheader()`](api.html#streamlit.subheader).

```python
st.header("I'm a large heading")
st.subheader("I'm not a large heading")
```

### Write some sentences

There's more than one way to add text to your apps. Whether you're working
with plain text, markdown, or want the flexibility to use both, Streamlit's got
you covered. Let's take a look at each method and when you should use it. Don't
forget, you need to save after adding a method to your app so that it'll
show up in the browser.

If you want to add some simple fixed-width text to your app use
[`st.text()`](api.html#streamlit.text).

```python
st.text('Welcome to Streamlit.')
```

There are times when you need more than plain text. With
[`st.markdown`](api.html#streamlit.markdown) you can write content for your
app in [Github-flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). This
method is perfect for when you need to emphasize text with bold or italics, or
add a link to related documentation.

```python
st.markdown(
    '**NOTE:** Markdown is perfect for when you want to _emphasize_ elements '
    'in your app.')
```

There's one more method we're going to cover that allows you to add text to a
app. [`st.write()`](api.html#streamlit.write) is the only text method that
accepts multiple arguments and data types. Along with [magic
commands](api.html#magic-commands), [`st.write()`](api.html#streamlit.write) is
the "Swiss Army knife" of Streamlit commands.

You can pass almost anything to [`st.write`](api.html#streamlit.write): text,
data, Matplotlib figures, Altair charts, and more. Don't worry, Streamlit will
figure it our and render it the right way. While powerful, there are
limitations, so we encourage you to review the [API
reference](api.html#streamlit.write).

Let's take a look at how you can use `st.write()` to display text and a Pandas
data frame:

```eval_rst
.. note::
   Streamlit has dedicated methods that can be used to visualize data frames,
   charts, histograms and more. We'll cover those in the next section.
```

```python
st.write("Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:")
st.write(pandas.DataFrame({
  'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
  'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
}))
```

## Write to your app without any Streamlit command

Streamlit supports "[magic commands](api.html#magic-commands)" that allow you
to write to your app without calling any `st.something()` method. This means
you don't usually have to write [`st.write`](api.html#streamlit.write) at all!
So the code above could be replaced with:

```python
"Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:"

df = pandas.DataFrame({
  'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
  'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
})

df
```

How it works is simple: any time Streamlit sees a variable or a literal value
on its own line, it automatically writes that to your app using
[`st.write`](api.html#streamlit.write). For more information, refer to the
documentation on [magic commands](api.html#magic-commands).

## Visualize data

Text is great, but Streamlit's strength is the ability to quickly manipulate
data, display it, and share it. In this section, you'll learn how to use
Streamlit methods to create interactive tables, charts, histograms, and more.

```eval_rst
.. tip::
   This guide focuses on Streamlit's core features. We're adding new
   functionality all the time, so make sure that you check out our API
   reference for `data <api.html#display-data>`__ and `charts
   <api.html#display-charts>`__.
```

### Display data and tables

There are a few ways to display data (tables, arrays, data frames) in Streamlit
apps. In the previous section, you were introduced to _magic_ and `st.write()`,
which can be used to write anything from text to tables. Now let's take a look
at methods designed specifically for visualizing data. You might be asking
yourself, "why wouldn't I always use `st.write()`?" Two reasons:

1. Magic and `st.write` inspect the type of the data you passed in, and then
   decide how to best draw it in the app. But sometimes you want to draw it
   another way. For example, instead of drawing a dataframe as an interactive
   table, you may want to draw it as a static table by using `st.table(df)`.
2. The second reason is that other methods return an object that can be used
   to modify it by adding data or replacing it with a completely different
   element.
3. Finally, if you use a more specific Streamlit method you can pass additional
   arguments to customize its behavior.

For example, let's create a data frame and change its formatting with a Pandas
Styler object. In this sample, you'll use Numpy to generate a random sample,
and the [`st.dataframe()`](api.html#streamlit.dataframe) method to draw the
interactive table.

```eval_rst
.. note::
   This sample uses Numpy to generate a random sample, but you can use Pandas
   DataFrames, Numpy arrays, or plain Python arrays.
```

```Python
dataframe = numpy.random.randn(10, 20)
st.dataframe(dataframe)
```

Let's expand on the first example using the Pandas `Styler` object to highlight
some elements in the interactive table.

```eval_rst
.. note::
   If you used PIP to install Streamlit, you'll need to install Jinja2 to use
   the Styler object. To install Jinja2, run: `pip install jinja2`.
```

```Python
dataframe = pandas.DataFrame(
    numpy.random.randn(10, 20),
    columns=('col %d' % i for i in range(20)))

st.dataframe(dataframe.style.highlight_max(axis=0))
```

Streamlit also has a method for static table generation:
[`st.table()`](api.html#streamlit.table).

```Python
dataframe = pandas.DataFrame(
    numpy.random.randn(10, 20),
    columns=('col %d' % i for i in range(20)))
st.table(dataframe)
```

### Draw bar charts, line charts, and maps

Streamlit supports several popular data charting libraries that allow you to
add different types of charts and data representations to your apps, like
Matplotlib, Altair, Deck.Gl, and more. In this section, you'll add a bar chart,
line chart, and a map to your app. If you'd like to see a full list of
supported charts and libraries, see [API reference](api.html#display-charts).

The [`st.bar_chart()`](api.html#streamlit.bar_chart) allows you to add bar
charts to your app. This example uses a Pandas data frame with three columns
as the data source.

```Python
chart_data = pandas.DataFrame(
    [[20, 30, 50]],
    columns=['a','b', 'c'])

st.bar_chart(chart_data)
```

Drawing a line chart is just as easy as drawing a bar chart with
[`st.line_chart()`](api.html#streamlit.line_chart). The only difference is that
we're going to generate a random sample using Numpy.

```Python
chart_data = pandas.DataFrame(
     numpy.random.randn(20, 3),
     columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

st.line_chart(chart_data)
```

With [`st.map()`](api.html#streamlit.map) you can display data points on a map.
Let's use Numpy to generate some sample data and plot it on San Francisco.

```Python
map_data = pandas.DataFrame(
    numpy.random.randn(1000, 2) / [50, 50] + [37.76, -122.4],
    columns=['lat', 'lon'])

st.map(map_data)
```

## Update existing elements

Every time you update your app and save, Streamlit's UI will ask if you'd
like to **rerun** the app. Then Streamlit, does a bunch of computer-sciencey
magic to make sure your app is updated efficiently and rendered in the
browser.

In this section, you'll learn how to update existing elements in an app.

### Replace text with text

Whenever you use a Streamlit method to place text, charts, or data into your
Streamlit app, a reference to that element is returned. You can call methods
on that reference to update the element with more data, or completely replace
it with something else.

Let's start with an easy example. Here you're going to create a text element,
then update (or overwrite) that element.

```Python
my_element = st.text('Hello sun.')
# Draws 'Hello sun' in the Streamlit app,
# and saves that reference. This slot can be reused.

my_element.text('Goodnight moon.')
# Replaces 'Hello sun' with 'Goodnight moon' in the app.
```

### Replace text with a data frame/chart

Now, let's replace the text element with a dataframe.

```Python
# You'll use time to simulate loading data
import time

# Draws 'Loading data...' in the Streamlit app.
my_second_element = st.text('Loading data...')

update_dataframe = pandas.DataFrame(
    numpy.random.randn(10, 20),
    columns=('col %d' % i for i in range(20)))

# Simulates loading a large data set.
time.sleep(5)

# Replaces 'Loading data...' with a table containing sample data.
my_second_element.dataframe(update_dataframe)
```

### Append data to a chart

You can do more than just replace elements. You can also add to and modify
existing elements, like charts and tables. Let's take a look at how you'd add a
row to a line chart.

```Python
# Get some data.
data = numpy.random.randn(10, 2)

# Show the data as a chart.
chart = st.line_chart(data)

# Wait 1 second, so the change is clearer.
time.sleep(1)

# Grab some more data.
data2 = numpy.random.randn(10, 2)

# Append the new data to the existing chart.
chart.add_rows(data2)
```

## Show progress

When adding long running computations to an app, you can use
[`st.progess`](api.html#streamlit.progress) to
display status in real time.

First, let's import `time`. We're going to use `time.sleep()` method to simulate
a long running computation:

```Python
import time
```

Now, let's create a progress bar:

```Python
'Starting a long computation...'

# Add a placeholder
latest_iteration = st.empty()
bar = st.progress(0)

for i in range(101):
  # Update the progress bar with each iteration.
  latest_iteration.text('Iteration %d' % i)
  bar.progress(i + 1)
  time.sleep(0.1)

'...and now we\'re done!'
```

## Add interactivity with widgets

With widgets, Streamlit allows you to bake interactivity directly into your
apps with checkboxes, buttons, sliders, and more. Let's look at a few
samples.

```eval_rst
.. tip::
   We're adding new functionality all the time, so make sure that you check out
   our `API reference <api.html#display-interactive-widgets>`__ for a full list
   of interactive widgets.
```

### Use a checkbox to hide/show data

One use case for checkboxes is to hide or show a specific chart or section in
an app. [`st.checkbox`](api.html#streamlit.checkbox) takes a single argument,
which is the widget label. In this sample, the checkbox is used to toggle a
conditional statement.

```Python
if st.checkbox('Show dataframe'):
    chart_data = pandas.DataFrame(
       numpy.random.randn(20, 3),
       columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

    st.line_chart(chart_data)
```

### Filter data with a slider

There are plenty of things you can do with a slider, and a good example is
filtering data. The [`st.slider`](api.html#streamlit.slider) method take a few
arguments, primarily the label, initial value, minimum value, maximum value,
and step.

In this sample, you'll assign the slider to a variable. This variable can be
used to pass data to another function, such as a table or chart, and change
the data in real time.

```Python
sample_var = st.slider('hour', 0, 23, 17)  # min: 0h, max: 23h, default: 17h
```

## Order the elements of an app

So far you've learned how to use the methods exposed by Streamlit to add new
elements to an app. These have all been additive, with the assumption that
you already know what you want to add to the app. What if you're unsure of
the structure, or need to add a placeholder for content that isn't quite ready?
That's where [`st.empty()`](api.html#streamlit.empty) comes in handy. It allows
you to add an empty slot to your app that you can update at any time.

Let's take a look at how you can use `st.empty` to add structure to an app.

```Python
## Appends a title to the app.
st.title('App with placeholders')

# Appends some text to the app.
st.text('Some interesting text about your interesting project.')

# Appends an empty slot to the app.
my_slot1 = st.empty()

# Appends another empty slot to the app.
my_slot2 = st.empty()

# Appends some more text to the app.
st.text('This is where you provide a killer conclusion.')

# Replaces the first empty slot with a text string.
my_slot1.text(
    'You can use a slot whenever you have something to say, draw, '
    'or represent.')

# Replaces the second empty slot with a chart.
my_slot2.line_chart(numpy.random.randn(20, 2))
```
